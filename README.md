# HtoA-MayaShaders
Loading MayaShaders in Houdini
a simple way to load MayaShader in Houdini or any others DCC is to add variable
ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH and point to that file like this:
ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH= C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Arnold\maya2020\shaders
most of the shaders are deprecated and not organised, since there is no mtd file to create a GUI as you can see in the picture bellow!

So I created a GUI for the non deprected Shdaers only and group the deprecated shaders for for conviance!
